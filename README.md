# Timed Coding Quiz

## The Goal

Create a website, using javascript and DOM manipulation, where someone can take a javascript quiz. 
Site should display and cycle through questions and answers. Correct answers will increase your score, 
incorrect answers will penalise you by reducing the time you have left to complete the quiz!

## What I've Done

Imitated examples to the best of my ability. Site displays an intro and start button. When clicked, 
start button initialises the quiz. Timer begins counting down from 60 seconds. 

Player can then select answers, and cycle through the five available questions.Incorrect answers reduce 
time left by 15 seconds. Correct answers increase score by 1 point.

Bonus: Added a reset button so you can retake the quiz without refreshing the browser!
